## Projects
### Project 1: Regression Analysis and Resampling Methods
In this project we run Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression on the Franke Function and Terrain Data. 
We have one file "functions.py" containing all the functions used in this project. We also have a separate file for each exercise. These are named "ex1.py", "ex2.py" etc.. 
The folder UploadedFigures contains all the plots created when running the exercises.
**How to use:**
By simply running the files for each exercise, all of the results in our report are reproduced.
